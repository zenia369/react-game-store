# Hiii.
It is repo for react-game-store and you can see progress of development for this site. 

Here we are had link: <https://react-game-store-xi.vercel.app/>

## Store technology
In this project I`m use Rawg API for data, RTK & query, Framer-motion for animations.

### Naming api`s
- get upcoming games
- get popular games
- get new games
- get games by name query

### RTK
So, redux for this project it`s must have. Also, in slices used createAsyncThunk for getting data when app starts and for api used createApi for cool controls data fetching.
